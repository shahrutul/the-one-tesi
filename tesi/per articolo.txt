B. Evaluation of delegation efficiency

We compare the efficiency of our system, which employs
delegations, against two other systemsthe system where there are no delegations
and file exchange is initiated only when a peer holding the
requested data is found directly by the file requester. The
metric we study is the average found time (Ftavg) for a specific
multimedia file. The found time (Ft) is the time interval
between the first delegation made and the time an output return
for that specific file is received. If no delegation is made and
the first file request is satisfied directly between a file owner
and the file requester, the Ftavg is equal to zero.
To this purpose we implemented the two protocols in
THE_ONE [14], a DTN simulation environment for delay
tolerant networks. For sake of simplicity, delegations are one
hop only, i.e., a servant peer cannot further delegate the task to
other frequently encountered peers of its own. Also the
software is always operational, there is only one active session
configured that covers all day user activity.
We stated before that synthetic mobility models are not
realistic and to this purpose we try to simulate a more realistic
scenario provided by the Working Day Movement model [15]
implemented for THE_ONE. In our scenario we have a
population of nodes (N) which emulate people operating
M2MShare and are involved in their daily activities according
to the cycle, home-work-event-home. A node at home is
inactive, thus the software is not operative. Nodes are
uniformly distributed between the available districts in the
default map available in THE_ONE and the simulation time is
set to two days, during which there are two full cycles home-
work-event-home; each cycle home-work-event amounts at
12 h. Therefore, the maximum simulation time during which a
node can be active amounts to 24 h.
The file population (Fp) parameter denotes the percentage
of nodes that posses the required file. The node requesting the
file is randomly chosen between the population and we repeat
the experiment 40 times in order to achieve more accurate
results, independent from the initial user starting point.
In the first scenario (Fig. 1) we consider Fp = 20%. The
protocol not employing delegations (purple line in the chart) is
not able to find any piece of the file during the simulation time
when the considered nodes in the scenario are equal or less
than 50. We have indicated this in the chart by assigning to
Ftavg a value of 24 h. This is due to the trivial strategy
employed by the protocol and to the sparse environment. Even
when able to find some node possessing the file (with N â‰¥ 100),
the time needed results bigger than when employing our
solution for task delegation (blue line in the chart). Clearly,
when increasing the file population (Fp), even the number of
nodes in the population that posses the data file increases; as a
result, the time to retrieve the file decreases for both solutions.
A similar result is achieved also when considering a wider
popularity for the required multimedia file (Fp = 50%, in
Fig. 2). However, in this case, the higher popularity of the
requested file helps both solutions in finding the file possessor
with a smaller Ftavg than in the previous scenario.
Finally, in Fig. 3, the performances of the two compared
solutions are very similar. This is due to the high file popularity
among nodes (Fp = 80%): the chances of eventually finding a
file possessor in a short time are clearly much higher.
The results are intuitive and conclusive; delegations extend
the requestor nodes search area, giving them the possibility to
reach the data file outside their environment.
