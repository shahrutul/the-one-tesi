In DTNs mobility and low node density require new strategies to implement a file-sharing application which allow the exchange of multimedia contents between mobile devices. M2MShare \cite{tesiarmir} uses Bluetooth to create a Peer-to-Peer overlay network and uses node mobility to reach data content on other local disconnected networks. The main idea of this protocol is to use a store-delegate-and-forward model. This is similar to the store-and-forward strategy widely used in DTNs, but M2MShare adds the \textit{delegate} part to the model. The result is an asynchronous communication model where a peer delegates an unaccomplished task to other peers in the overlay network.
\\

Delegations are used to extend search and diffusion area for a shared file, while M2MSHare dynamically establishes forward routes along the destination path by exploiting social relations existing between peers users. This is done by limiting delegations only to frequently encountered peers, which users can pass on by the same geographical location at the same time frequently enough. The history of previous encounters is then used as heuristic evaluation of whether a peer is a good candidate for delegations. This allows assigning tasks only to nodes that we should meet again in the future, so they can return the result of the task back to us.
\\

In this chapter we describe the protocol from a top-down prospective, showing some details about the modules (\figurename~\ref{fig:stack-M2MShare}) which compose M2MShare architecture.

%Mobility and low node density require a revision of networking protocols toward a delay tolerant approach. In this section we expose some operational details of M2MShare, the application we designed and implemented to demonstrate the opportunistic DTN approach in mobile to mobile multimedia content sharing.
%
%M2Mshare uses the Bluetooth to create a P2P overlay networks, which would allow the automatic exchange of multimedia content among smartphones. Our software automatically initiates a search by broadcasting the userâ€™s query request toward other Bluetooth enabled devices operating the program. Once the answer/s is received, data found to match the criteria will be automatically requested for download. All this process is done without the user mediation; the user only needs to specify the search terms, configurable through the user interface and chose from the matched content list. Key features of M2MShare are its ease of use and autonomy, once the initial preferences are set up no further user interaction is needed and the user can find downloaded files directly on her/his phone, when done.
%Given that energy consumption is a problem for handheld devices the notion of active sessions was introduced. An active session is a period of time in which the software is functional and performs its duties and such periods are configurable through the graphical user interface. This way, the user can set the application to look for requested contents only in certain periods of the day; for instance, when commuting or during lunch time in the cafeteria, so as to be active only when it could be useful since the high number of other peers around.
%
%M2MSHare uses node mobility to reach data content on other local disconnected networks. This is achieved by introducing an asynchronous communication model, store-delegate-and-forward where a peer delegates and unaccomplished/unsatisfied task to other peers in the overlay network. M2MSHare dynamically establishes forward routes (delegations) along the destination path by exploiting social relations existing between users operating mobile wireless devices, whose activity is entirely user-transparent Delegating tasks to all encountered peers is energy and bandwidth consuming. Also, it would be useless to assign tasks to peers that will never be met again in the future. To avoid this M2MShare exploits social relations and delegates tasks only to frequently encountered peers, peers whom are expected to be encountered again in the future.
%
%We could say that we exploit social relations among users to determine possible task delegates. This is not a new approach as context and social relations are already studied in opportunistic data transmission. Yet, we utilize even unknown social relations by connecting users that have to pass by the same geographical location at the same time frequently enough. To assume that a candidate for task delegation could be met again in the future (so that she/he will be able to deliver contents possibly found), we use as an heuristic the history of previous encounters.

\section{DTN module}
DTNs are particularly useful in situations with intermittent connectivity and long and unpredictable intervals in contacts between nodes. Routing protocols developed for and used in the Internet are not suitable for use in mobile networks, where every node has a limited connection range and high mobility. These factors make it difficult, and sometimes impossible, to establish an end-to-end connection between source and destination nodes.
\\

In a Peer to Peer application it is also fundamental to have a high availability of shared files, to ensure the recovery of a searched file. This implies the need for a high number of simultaneously connected nodes, which we saw was not so obvious in a mobile network.
\\

To overcome these limitations, M2MShare uses an asynchronous communication strategy in which a \textit{client} peer, in search for a file, can delegate to another peer, a \textit{servant}, the task of searching for the file and returning it to the requester. Delegation system is at the root of M2MShare. This permits widely extending the area of where to look for the searched file, in a network composed of spread out and poorly connected nodes.
\\

Before proceeding further it would be useful to explain in what a delegation action consists of. A delegation is the action performed by a client peer which asks a servant peer to execute some unaccomplished task of its own. This unaccomplished task can be a query, composed of several keywords, for which the client wants to receive a list of files which satisfy it. To accomplish this task, the servant schedules it for later execution and searches among shared files in encountered nodes for some file satisfying the query. When the pending task is completed, the servant creates a new task type, a forward task. The objective of this kind of task is to return the output of a pending task to the requester node. 
\\
One task can be delegated by the client to several servant peers and this allows using nodes mobility as an advantage instead of a negative factor. A client node can virtually enter in contact range with nodes that it would never otherwise meet.

All delegated tasks also have a Time To Live (TTL) value. If a delegated task is not completed and its result has not been returned to the client within its TTL value the task expires, it is deleted and not scheduled again for execution in the servant.
\\

\subsection{Servant Election}
The entire task life-cycle is done in an infrastructure-less environment, where routing paths are dynamically created during execution. Therefore it is important to choose wisely which peers can be elected as servants.
\\

The simpler choice would be to delegate an unaccomplished task to every met node. This might not be a good strategy in servant election. Delegating a task to every met node would be very expensive in bandwidth usage and in energy consumption. These factors are very important in a mobile environment where nodes have limited energy autonomy. 
\\

A possible solution would be to analyse common interests between client and other peers. \cite{socialNetworks} shows a strategy for data diffusion in which a node shares only certain kinds of data to another node, accordingly to their common interests and relationship. If the other peer is a friend it would be convenient to share data related to their common interests. If the other is not a friend node, the client node would share the data most different from their common interests.
\\

Once the task has been delegated it is then fundamental that its result is forwarded back to the client. Otherwise the delegation would be useless. M2MShare strategy is to elect as servants only nodes that we expect to meet again. As we will see in Section \ref{descrWDM}, related to Working Day Movement model, one person's daily activities can highlight a repetitiveness in movements and met people. Spontaneous and temporary \textit{communities} are created by people who meet regularly, i.e. colleagues who work in the same office, commuters who use the same transportation to reach their work place, etc..
\\

The idea behind M2MShare is that a frequently encountered person is a person that we will probably meet again and therefore it is a good candidate for servant election. To evaluate how frequently a node will meet another node, M2MShare uses an active daemon called \textit{PresenceCollector}, described in Section \ref{descrPresenceCollector}. This daemon traces the number of encounters, scanning at regular intervals for other nodes within communication range. When the number of encounters with another node exceeds the value of a parameter called \textit{Frequency Threshold}, that node is elected as servant.
\\

The numbers of encounters with other peers are saved in a list with limited length. This limitation is adopted to guarantee limited memory usage. To allow each peer the possibility to serve as servant, a replacement strategy is adopted for entries in encounter list. When a peer is elected as servant, its entry is removed from the list. If a peer is not elected as a servant and its entry remains on the list for a long time period, then it is removed from the list. The maximum time a peer can be on the list without being elected as servant is related to a value called \textit{Probation Window}. If the list is full and a new peer is encountered, its information is discarded. A new peer can enter in the list only when a slot is freed by the replacement strategy.

\section{Search module}
Before a user can choose what file to download from the network, it must know what files are shared by other users and find what it is looking for in them. Every peer in the network maintains a local repository of files shared with other M2MShare users. For every file information is available about file name, dimension, position in local file system and an hash value that univocally identifies that file in the network.
\\

There are two kinds of file queries: 

\begin{description}
\item[Unique file query:] a single file is searched and a boolean answer (present / not present) is needed.
\item[Keyword query:] the user asks for a list of files satisfying some keyword included in the query.
\end{description}

To satisfy a keyword query, M2MShare uses the Inverted Index List strategy. Every shared file is indexed under a finite number of terms contained in the file description text and during a query execution the Search module looks in these terms for files suitable for the response.


\section{Transport module}
M2MShare operates on devices with limited memory and calculation resources. Each device must simultaneously handle incoming requests for uploads and delegations from other peers and user requests issued on the device itself. If these requests were executed in parallel, then each one would require a separate execution flow. With the limited device resources, this could cause substantial memory usage and consequently, probably crash the application.
\\

In Transport Module, M2MShare manages active tasks queuing, and executing only a limited number of them simultaneously. Tasks are divided in different kinds and this permits applying different policies to different types of requests. These policies are implemented using different task queues and a component called \textit{QueuingCentral} which manages the queues. It also imposes limits on the maximum number of tasks a single peer can handle.
\\

When a task is created or received from another peer delegation, it is queued in the related queue and scheduled for later execution. The queues managed by the QueuingCentral are:
\begin{description}
\item[dtnDownloadQueue:] includes remote tasks which indicate that a servant peer has completed a previously delegated task.
\item[dtnPendingQueue:] includes tasks previously delegated from other peers. The current peer acts as servant for these tasks.
\item[dtnPendingUpload:] includes completed tasks previously delegated from other peers. The current peer is ready to forward the result of these tasks.
\item[queryQueue:] includes user-issued queries.
\item[uploadQueue:] includes data requests from other peers.
\item[virtualFileQueue:] includes user-issued file download requests.
\end{description}

Tasks execution is scheduled by a component called \textit{Scheduler}, which extracts tasks from related queues and executes them. Inside each queue tasks are inserted and fetched with a FIFO policy. The Scheduler includes four execution flows used to implement inter-queue policies and to assign different priorities to different task types. Some tasks can use several execution flows, with a maximum number of flows for each task. This permits, for example, simultaneous downloading of pieces of the same file from different sources.
\\

One of the highlights of M2MShare is task delegation. This is done by remotely communicating task informations to a servant peer. The task, when active, is encoded using serialization on the client side, transmitted to the servant peer and there the task is decoded and queued to the correct queue related to pending tasks.

%Provides the task queuing mechanism and task lifecycle management. We discuss about the necessity of resource management given the fact that mobile devices are resource constraint and extend our solution to this. An important part of this section is the communication protocol that individual tasks implement along with a detailed analysis of the data packets exchanged during communication. Finally, we introduce the file division strategy and provide some test results that demonstrate its efficiency over other division strategies


\section{Routing module}
M2MShare uses this module for query routing, using a relay method borrowed from ORION \cite{orion}. In every node, a structure similar to ORION File Routing Table is used to store alternative paths to file shared in remote peers. The usage of this structure allows to keep file locations transparent to the requester node. From its point of view, all files are shared by in-reach area nodes, while these act as relay nodes during file transfers.\\
A flood control mechanism is implemented using a technique borrowed from AODV \cite{aodv}. Query requests are uniquely identified and every node maintains an \textit{ID} which is incremented on each broadcast issued. When a node receives new requests, it checks to see if the request has been already forwarded, before broadcasting it.



\section{MAC module}
\label{descrPresenceCollector}
We saw that a node must be met several times before being elected as a servant. To evaluate if a peer is a frequently encountered peer and eventually elect it as a servant, M2MShare uses a daemon called \textit{PresenceCollector}, which periodically scans the network for in-reach area devices. 
\\

Scan frequency is a very important parameter. It influences energy consumption and probability for another peer to be elected as a servant. The presence collector is always active, so a high scan frequency is not reasonable because it results in waste in the network bandwidth and device energy. Also, a high frequency results in a high probability that a node will be elected as a servant: the number of encounters raises and the \textit{Frequency Threshold} is exceeded faster than with a low scan frequency value.
\\

While scan frequency can be set by the user, additional efforts have been made to automatically tune the \textit{Frequency Threshold} value. This is the other parameter that affects the probability of a node being elected as a servant: a few encounters are enough, with a low value, to exceed the threshold value. If the value is too low, we might delegate a task to peers that we would never meet again, resulting in the results of the task never being forwarded. On the other hand, with a high \textit{Frequency Threshold} value, many promising peers might be rejected from being elected as servants.
\\

At the beginning of every day, M2MShare uses a tuning algorithm which adapts the \textit{Frequency Threshold} value according to the observations made during the previous day. Considered values are the number of elected peers and \textit{Probation Window} value. A peer is considered frequently encountered if it is met a number of times greater than the \textit{Frequency Threshold} in a period as long as the \textit{Probation Window} value. After this period, if a peer has not yet been elected, it is removed from the encounter list. If \textit{Probation Window} value is high and few nodes are elected, the  \textit{Frequency Threshold} is lowered, making it more probable for a node to be elected. On the other hand, if the number of elected peers is too high, the \textit{Probation Window} is lowered. When its value reaches the minimum value (set to 2 days), the \textit{Frequency Threshold} is raised.


\section{File Division Strategy}
\label{descrFileDivisionStrategy}
Bluetooth file transfer applications usually adopt a client-server paradigm where devices pair with each other for the entire duration of data transfer. If the transfer is interrupted, exchanged data is of no use. This is because every file transfer has to start from the beginning. 
\\

In a mobile environment such as the one where M2MShare operates, disconnections between nodes are very frequent. The standard file transfer strategy is not suitable for this environment, because pairing for the entire duration of data exchange could be very difficult. We must remember that M2MShare should be entirely user transparent, so the user need not worry about file transfers. Data exchange should run automatically whenever possible and the transfer strategy should adopt transfer resume.
\\

M2MShare provide a file division strategy where files are divided in intervals of variable size. The file is seen as a map of non overlapping intervals of variable length that need to be downloaded. So, when one node asks another node for a file, it asks only for not yet downloaded intervals. If a disconnection occurs, the download can restart with the remaining not yet downloaded intervals.
\\

One of the characteristics of this file division strategy is the starting point of file transfers. If every file transfer starts from the beginning of the file, with several file possessors in the area of reach, there would be overlapping downloaded intervals downloaded. Overlapping data is of no use, creating redundancy, and M2MShare file division strategy tries to minimize that redundancy. This is done by assigning a different \textit{download map} to each file possessor. A download map is a list of not yet downloaded intervals, with a starting point which identifies the interval from which to initiate fetching data. The starting point is calculated by considering the number of intervals the file is composed of, the length of the file and the index of the next interval to be fetched. For additional details refer to \cite{tesiarmir}.
\\

The fact that each file possessor is asked for the file starting from different points allows reconstructing the whole file even if just part of it is downloaded from each of them. When the requested interval has been downloaded, if the file possessor is still in reach, the rest of the map is requested. In case of task delegation, a data download might be delegated to a servant peer, and in this case the entire download map is communicated to the servant device.
