%In this thesis, we evaluated the performance of M2MShare, a protocol which implements DTN techniques in mobile phones world, in order to enable a peer-to-peer file sharing system between peers in the network making leverage on their mobility and opportunistic contacts among them. To do so we implemented the protocol in the Oppostunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator. This simulator is able to emulate human movement adopting several movement models in a map-based environment and allow us to evaluate M2MShare behaviour in a realistic city-scale scenario.
In this thesis, we discuss and evaluate M2MShare, a DTN solution for mobile phones that leverages on nodes' mobility and opportunistic contacts to enable proximity based file sharing. To this aim, we have integrated M2MShare in the Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator and tested its performance with realistic movement models in a map-based environment. This complex city-scale testbed includes a multitude of nodes representing real users engaged in their daily activities and movements, and allowed us to demonstrate the efficacy of M2MShare.
