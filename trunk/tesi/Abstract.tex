In this thesis, we evaluated the performance of M2MShare, a protocol which implements DTN techniques in mobile phones world, in order to enable a peer-to-peer file sharing system between peers in the network making leverage on their mobility and opportunistic contacts among them. To do so we implemented the protocol in the Oppostunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator. This simulator is able to emulate human movement adopting several movement models in a map-based environment and allow us to evaluate M2MShare behaviour in a realistic city-scale scenario.
